I can guide you on how to create a new repository on GitHub or how to fork an existing repository to keep contributing to it. Here are the steps for both scenarios:

### Create a New Repository:
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
3. Fill in the details for your new repository, including the repository name, description, and choose whether it's public or private.
4. Optionally, choose to initialize the repository with a README file, add a .gitignore file, or choose a license.
5. Click on the "Create repository" button to create your new repository.

### Fork an Existing Repository:
1. Go to the GitHub repository you want to contribute to.
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository page.
3. Select the account or organization where you want to fork the repository.
4. Once the forking process is complete, you will be redirected to your forked repository.
5. Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command.

Now, you can start contributing to your new repository or the forked repository by making changes, committing them, and pushing them back to GitHub.
